# Etch a Sketch

This [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch application created as part of [The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It allows users to draw on a 16x16 grid of squares, using mouse interactions to create colorful trails as they hover over the grid.

## Features

- Generate a customizable grid size based on user input (up to 100 squares per side)
- Change the color of grid squares on hover to simulate drawing
- The grid maintains a fixed total pixel area for a consistent drawing experience

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript

## Project Goals

- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Implement a flexible grid layout using Flexbox.
- Experiment with JavaScript functions for user interaction and grid generation.
